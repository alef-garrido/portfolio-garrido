# Garrido's Official Portfolio

>  My official portfolio v1. I wanted to try developing a beautiful design (acknowledgments below) that immediately caught my eye. It was powered by a no-code tool and I really had fun replicating all its features. I believe it reflects minimalism, proportion, white space, and a simple but lovely user experience. Hope you like it!
